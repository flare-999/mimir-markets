/*
 * Server-side helpers for resolving on-chain addresses to council personas.
 *
 * Pages like /agents, /stats, /council, and /vs/[id] need to map a raw
 * address to a persona spec (emoji, displayName, accent colors) so the UI
 * can show e.g. "🌙 The Optimist" instead of "0x3e5e…ffac".
 *
 * Lookups are address-keyed and EXACT. A Stellar `G…' strkey is case-sensitive
 * base32, so the case-insensitive matching this used for EVM hex would fold a
 * valid address into one that matches nothing. The map is built once per process
 * from the COUNCIL_<SLUG>_PUBLIC env vars.
