## Browser smoke flow (must stay green on release)

`npm run smoke:browser` builds the app with a **secret-free allowlist**, serves it
locally, drives the Playwright suite in `tests/browser/` with the system
Chrome/Chromium, and tears down. CI runs it as the `browser-smoke` job. When you
add a page, a wallet gate, or an env-read, keep it green:

Never let real settings into the smoke build. The harness moves every
.env* file aside during the run and builds with only buildSmokeEnv() keys.
If the app needs a new NEXT_PUBLIC_* value to even build, add it to
SMOKE_NEXT_PUBLIC and its regression test — but that must be a value that
is safe to ship to the browser in every build.
Assert the unconfigured state, not a live one. The smoke run has no DB, no
contract ids, no secrets. It pins fail-closed behavior: health 503 critical /
db.unconfigured, empty arena feed, money paths gated behind a connect control.
Do not add an assertion that depends on a live deployment.
New public pages go into tests/browser/pages.spec.ts with a signature
heading marker from messages/en.json.
New secret-shaped env vars: if you add one, confirm it is not in the
smoke allowlist; add it to the secret samples in tests/node/browser-smoke-env.test.ts.
Run it before finishing a release-touching PR: npm run smoke:browser.
Key rules
Contract state is the source of truth. Neon Postgres is a read-index cache only.
Two assets, one job each. Native XLM pays the ledger fee and the account
reserve, and nothing else — it is never an argument to a contract call, because
Soroban has no payable invocation. USDC (7 decimals, Circle's Testnet issuance
reached through its Stellar Asset Contract) carries every value flow: market
stakes, payouts, agent bankrolls and x402 payments.
Every account funds its own fees. There is no sponsorship, by product
decision: an operation costs ~100 stroops, so there is nothing worth sponsoring.
Stakes need no allowance. Soroban authorises per invocation:
challenge_claim carries an authorisation entry permitting exactly one USDC
transfer of exactly the staked amount. lib/contract.ts builds one transaction,
the user signs once. Allowances (lib/agents/spend-permissions.ts) exist only for
the delegated BYOA case.
A first-time account signs twice, once. A USDC trustline is a classic
operation and a transaction containing a Soroban operation must contain exactly
one operation, so the trustline cannot ride along with the stake.
Resolution is oracle-only. resolve_claim requires authorisation from the
oracle address stored in the contract. Do not expose user-triggered resolution.
Challenger settlement is pull-based. resolve_claim deliberately does not
loop over challengers: a transaction is capped on its ledger-entry footprint and
~100 challengers do not fit. It seeds remaining_escrow; each winner calls
claim_challenger_payout once, O(1), and the last claimant absorbs the dust.
withdraw and claim_fees are the other two pull paths.
Hash with SHA-256 (lib/content-hash.ts), never keccak. env.crypto().sha256()
is the Soroban host primitive, so a contract can recompute the digest; there is no
keccak host function. Both are 32 bytes, so every BytesN<32> field takes it
unchanged — but a pre-migration digest will not match a fresh one.
Agents sign with local Stellar seeds held only in the worker process env
(STELLAR_ORACLE_SECRET, CREATOR_SECRET, COUNCIL_<SLUG>_SECRET). The web
server never sees a seed — only G… addresses for display and payment routing.
G…/C… strkeys are case-sensitive base32. Never lowercase one for
comparison; the EVM toLowerCase() habit turns a valid address into one that
matches nothing.
Paid endpoints speak x402 v2 only, in the Stellar-native exact scheme: the
buyer submits its own USDC Payment and presents a signed proof; the seller reads
the transaction back off Horizon. No facilitator, no HTTP third party. Never
reintroduce manual transaction inspection or custom payment headers.
Money is accounted in atomic integers. payments_v2.amount_atomic is
NUMERIC(78,0); decimals are applied at the API/UI edge only.
When a contract in contracts-soroban/ changes, regenerate bindings
(npm run stellar:bindings) and keep lib/contract.ts in sync.
Categories: sports, weather, crypto, culture, custom (English).
Sync/read-index changes must pass npm run check:ledger-fixture; see
docs/LEDGER_REPLAY.md for artifact, secret, release, and rollback policy.
Release readiness
npm run verify:release-readiness is the release checklist as data
(lib/ops/release-readiness.ts, documented in docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md). It
runs on a clean checkout with no .env, no DATABASE_URL, no seeds and no
network:

Default (develop) mode verifies what it can run itself - checklist
coherence, artifact provenance, the cache-backup fixture, the saved-ledger
replay and the release SBOM - and reports every other gate as not
evidenced (a warning), never as a pass.
--mode=release is the funded-release gate: a blocking gate with no
recorded evidence is an error. Evidence is a small JSON file passed with
--evidence; status is only ever pass or fail, so a gate cannot be
waived, skipped or bypassed.
Privacy: a recorded detail/artifact that looks like a credential
(Stellar seed, sk-/rk- key, gh*_ token, phc_ key, AKIA key, PEM
private key, or a URL with embedded credentials) is refused, not redacted.
Changing a gate: update lib/ops/release-readiness.ts and
docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md in the same pull request. The CLI fails when the
doc stops describing a gate id or its command, and
tests/node/release-readiness.test.ts pins the registry fingerprint, so the
checklist cannot drift silently.
Rollback: the checklist deploys nothing and writes nothing to the chain or
the database. --out writes a deterministic JSON release record (no
timestamps unless --stamp) that can be diffed between releases.

## Node test workflow (must stay green on release)

The release entry point is `npm run test:node`; `test:smoke` remains an alias
for callers that already use it. The runner discovers all
`tests/node/*.test.ts` files in deterministic order and explicitly preserves
Node's process-per-file isolation. It never uses shared-process test mode or
reruns only previously failed files.

The default runner creates `.cache/node-tests/` with Node's
`NODE_COMPILE_CACHE`. This is a compile-only optimization: no test result,
assertion, or coverage data is reused as a pass signal. The cache directory is
versioned by the Node version, lockfile, `tsx` version, and runner version;
a dependency, runtime, or runner change therefore misses the cache. Use
`--no-cache` for a forced cold run and `--clear-cache` before diagnosing a
cache problem. CI caches the same directory, but the manifest and versioned
path prevent stale entries from being trusted.

The runner uses a strict child-environment allowlist. It does not load
`.env.local` and does not pass production seeds, Stellar credentials, LLM keys,
database URLs, or arbitrary environment variables. Database-backed tests skip
unless the operator explicitly supplies `--with-db`; that option is for an
isolated test database only. A clean checkout must be able to run the default
suite with no network credentials, wallet seed, LLM key, or database.

`npm run test:node:coverage` runs the same complete suite and writes a fresh
LCOV report. On success the atomic artifact is
`coverage/node/node-tests.lcov`; on test failure it is
`coverage/node/node-tests.failed.lcov`, and the process still exits nonzero.
CI uploads either report with `if: always()` so a failed or cache-cold run is
observable. Reports contain source paths and coverage data, not environment
values or credentials. Coverage is supplemental reporting, not a reason to
skip tests, lower thresholds, or switch to shared process isolation.

Release and rollback rules:

- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:node:coverage`, and
  the contract/artifact checks before merging a runner change. A coverage
  report is not a substitute for the passing test exit status.
- Keep the cache and coverage directories ignored; never upload or commit
  either directory as a source artifact.
- To roll back, revert the runner, package scripts, and CI cache/artifact
  wiring. Removing `.cache/node-tests/` is sufficient for a local cache
  rollback. No contract, chain, database, or deployment rollback is required
  because the workflow performs no writes outside the ignored local/CI cache
  and coverage directories.

## Oracle agent

```bash
# Start the oracle (needs STELLAR_ORACLE_SECRET + an LLM key)
npm run oracle
The oracle polls for active claims past their deadline, fetches evidence,
evaluates with an LLM, and sends resolve_claim to the contract on Stellar Testnet.

Agents bootstrap
Bash

# 1. Generate all twelve keypairs (writes seeds + addresses into .env.local)
npm run agents:create-wallets

# 2. Fund from a master account (Friendbot tops up the master only).
#    Each agent needs test USDC for stakes plus a little XLM for fees and reserve.
npm run agents:fund

# 3. Deploy and initialize the contracts
npm run deploy:contract

# 4. Verify artifact provenance (no secrets), then the live deployment
npm run verify:artifacts
npm run verify:deployment
npm run smoke:onchain

# 5. Run workers
npm run workers   # oracle + market-creator + council + sync + traders
Buying data over x402 needs no sponsor and no separate approval: the agent pays
its own ~100-stroop fee and its own USDC. XLM is required for every write the
agent makes, including those payments.

Faucets: XLM from Friendbot (https://lab.stellar.org/account/fund), test USDC from
https://faucet.circle.com
Explorer: https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet
Public endpoints (rate-limited): https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org and
https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org

## Demo seed claims

Preview the fixed demo claim set without a signer, contract id, or network access:

```bash
npm run seed:dry -- --at 2030-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

`--at` requires an explicit timezone and is accepted only with `--dry-run`; every
preview then has stable absolute deadlines. A live `npm run seed` uses the current
clock and requires `CREATOR_SECRET`, a configured Testnet market contract, and
sufficient creator USDC. It does not use `STELLAR_DEPLOYER_SECRET`: demo market
stakes must be signed by the dedicated creator wallet, not a deployment authority.

Live writes are chain-first and cannot be rolled back as a batch. The script reports
each failed transaction and continues, so inspect the resulting claim IDs/transactions
before rerunning to avoid duplicate markets. Cancel an untouched claim only when the
contract permits it; once challenged, resolve and settle it through the normal
contract flow rather than editing or deleting read-index data. Generated signer
seeds remain private in local environment files and must never be committed.

## Read-index cache backup / restore (devx)

The Neon read-index is a cache, so its backup workflow is deliberately
verifiable without any network credentials — that is what makes the safety
property testable on a clean checkout and in CI.

- **Backup** (`npm run backup:read-index -- --out backups/x.json`) needs only
  `DATABASE_URL`. It dumps the projection tables (`claims`, `challengers`,
  `sync_meta`, `market_settlements`, `fee_accruals`, `fee_claims`,
  `fee_policies`, `agent_revenue_attribution`) and refuses to emit a byte unless
  its own checksum and privacy invariants pass. No seeds, no RPC, no LLM keys.
- **Verify** (`npm run verify:cache-backup -- <file>`) is a pure SHA-256 +
  schema + privacy check (`lib/ops/cache-backup.ts`). Fail-closed findings:
  `BACKUP_INVALID`, `BACKUP_KIND_MISMATCH`, `BACKUP_SCHEMA_UNSUPPORTED`,
  `BACKUP_MISSING_TABLE`, `BACKUP_UNKNOWN_TABLE`, `BACKUP_EMPTY`,
  `BACKUP_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH`, `BACKUP_PRIVATE_CONTENT_LEAK`. A private claim's
  scrubbed content fields must stay `null` in the archive.
- **Restore** (`npm run restore:read-index -- <file> [--dry-run]`) requires
  `DATABASE_URL`. An unverified archive is refused before any write; writes run
  in one transaction so a failure rolls back; afterwards the cache is re-read
  and its fingerprint is compared against the archive's checksum.
- **Rollback**: restore any verified archive, or — because contract state is
  the source of truth — re-warm from chain (`npm run warm:vs-index` / `npm run
  sync`). Restoring never writes to the chain.
- **Adding a table/column to the projection**: update `TABLE_SPECS` in
  `lib/server/read-index-backup.ts` **and** the regression-pinned
  `READ_INDEX_TABLES` list in `lib/ops/cache-backup.ts`, then regenerate the
  `valid.json` fixture. A column added to Postgres but not to `TABLE_SPECS` is
  intentionally never backed up — this is a feature (a secret-shaped column
  cannot sneak into archives) and it fails loud if you forget to wire it.
- Never commit real archives to the repo. The committed fixture in
  `tests/fixtures/cache-backup/valid.json` is synthetic.

## Schema snapshot gate (devx)

The Postgres schema is the ordered `SCHEMA_STATEMENTS` list in `lib/db.ts`; there
is no separate migration runner, so a schema edit ships on merge. The gate makes
that change reviewable:

- **Verify** (`npm run check:schema-snapshot`) rebuilds the snapshot from
  `getSchemaStatements()` and compares it with
  `schemas/db-schema.snapshot.json` (`lib/ops/schema-snapshot.ts`). Pure — no
  `DATABASE_URL`, no network, no secrets. It is a CI gate.
- **Update** a schema, index, or `schema_migrations` row, then run
  `npm run check:schema-snapshot -- --write` and commit the snapshot in the same
  pull request. Fail-closed findings: `SNAPSHOT_MISSING`, `SNAPSHOT_INVALID`,
  `EMPTY_SCHEMA`, `FINGERPRINT_MISMATCH`, `TABLE_DRIFT`, `INDEX_DRIFT`,
  `MIGRATION_DRIFT`, `MIGRATION_DUPLICATE_VERSION`, `MIGRATION_UNREGISTERED`.
- **Rollback**: revert the schema change and the snapshot together, then rerun
  the check; reverting only one leaves the gate failing by design. The read index
  is disposable and can be rebuilt from chain (`npm run warm:vs-index`).
- Every new table or index must ship with a `schema_migrations` registration; a
  schema with no registered migration fails `MIGRATION_UNREGISTERED`.
- Policy: [`docs/SCHEMA_SNAPSHOTS.md`](./SCHEMA_SNAPSHOTS.md).
