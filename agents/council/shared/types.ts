 * migration — keep reading the field names they always did. `agents/council/index.ts`
 * maps `ClaimData` onto this once, at the single fetch site.
 *
 * Two field types changed with the chain, and both are simplifications:
 *   - **stakes are display USDC**, not atomic bigints. `decodeClaim` converts at
 *     the boundary, so the evaluators compare plain numbers.
 *   - **`state` is a string** (`"open"` / `"active"` / …), mirroring the Soroban
 *     `ClaimState` enum by name. The old numeric discriminant invited off-by-one
 *     comparisons that silently skipped every freshly created market.
